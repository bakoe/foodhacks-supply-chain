A prototype of a web app displaying supply chains of food products. By showing this information to customers, both producers and retailers could extend their audience and increase their sales.

## Technical information

The web app is based on a [Mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.4.0/) map displaying some sample [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) data. It furthermore uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and the [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) framework.
